## jellyfin-plugin-lastfm

Enables audio scrobbling to Last.FM as well as a metadata fetcher source.

This plug-in was migrated from the original Emby repository and has been adapted to function within the Jellyfin ecosystem. This plugin *cannot* be distributed with Jellyfin due to a missing compatible license. I will attempt to keep this repo up-to-date and in-sync as the Jellyfin project matures.

## 🔧 Installation and Configuration

Install the plugin via the Jellyfin plugin repository. Navigate to `plugins` section of the admin dashboard, add the following repository to follow stable builds for this plugin.
* Repo name: LastFM Stable
* Repo URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielfariati/jellyfin-plugin-lastfm/refs/heads/master/manifest.json
